### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="30"/>

I'm Lieann, a computer science student at University of Florida, graduating May 2025

I'm primarily interested in **full-stack development** and currently intern remotely as a software developer.

I love learning new technologies, working with international teams, and streamlining systems and processes through automation.

Outside of work, my interests include exploring new cities, traveling, art and video games.
