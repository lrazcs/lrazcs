### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm Lieann, a software engineer and systems analyst in Ft Lauderdale, FL.

I currently work as a software engineer at Ace Aviation, where I develop, deploy and implement internal tools and software. Previously, I was an Applications Support Analyst at Phoenix Tower International.

I love learning new technologies, working with international teams, and streamlining systems and processes through automation.

Outside of work, my interests include exploring new cities, traveling, art and video games.
